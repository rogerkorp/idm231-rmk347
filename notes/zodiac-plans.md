## The Etherial Diner Zodiac

The Etherial Diner is a local resturant located at the corner of 15th Street and the Heat Death of the Universe. The staff understand all that was, is, and will be, and will simply give you the meal you need, regardless of wether you even asked for it.
Basically, the theme is "Supernatural Breakfast", with an emphasis on the ordinary colliding with the unknown. The zodiac will be based on twelve different breakfast foods, and the theme will be based on local diner imagery (Lots of warm colors, browns, greens.)
