# General Project Notes

## What's the Objective?

The main objective for this project is to create a zodiac website that incorperates JavaScript. Currently, the target is to complete this project by March 19th, 2021.

## What's the Plan?

1. Come up with a final concept for this Zodiac. They have to be unique, so I'm probably just going to list of groups of 12 things in order to generate ideas.
2. Create a flowchart to outline how the app will work.
3. Create some wireframes in Adobe XD to make a basic UI for this. I will be graded on this after all.
4. Establish a style guide. Finalize the look and feel of the Website and the Typography. Make it unique to the concept.
5. Pull together some image drafts and some sound effects that will fit.

I will, of course, update the repository with any files that come out of this plan.
